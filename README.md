# **Sleep Time Analysis Project**  

## **Project Description**  
This project analyzes sleep patterns and factors affecting sleep duration and quality. Using R and statistical modeling techniques, it explores trends, correlations, and possible predictors of sleep habits.  

## **Dataset**  
- The dataset contains information on individuals' sleep duration, habits, and related variables.  
- Possible variables include:\n  - **Sleep Duration** (Total sleep time in hours)  
  - **Bedtime** (Time of going to bed)  
  - **Wake-up Time**  
  - **Sleep Quality Score**  
  - **Physical Activity Levels**  
  - **Screen Time Before Bed**  
  - **Caffeine Intake**  
  - **Stress Levels**  

## **Methods and Analysis**  
1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**  
   - Handling missing values and outliers  
   - Converting categorical variables if necessary  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visualizing sleep patterns  
   - Identifying correlations between sleep duration and other factors  
3. **Modeling & Statistical Analysis**  
   - Regression models to predict sleep duration  
   - Hypothesis testing for key factors  
   - Machine learning techniques (if applicable)  

## **Setup and Usage**  
### **Required Libraries**  
Ensure these R packages are installed before running the analysis:  
```r  
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "ggplot2", "dplyr", "lme4", "caret"))  
```  
### **Execution Steps**  
1. Place the dataset in the project directory.  
2. Open `sleeptime.Rmd` in RStudio.  
3. Run the notebook step by step to analyze sleep patterns.  

## **Expected Outputs**  
- Insights on factors affecting sleep quality and duration  
- Visualizations of sleep trends  
- Statistical model results for sleep prediction  

## **Future Improvements**  
- Extending analysis with **wearable device data**  
- Implementing **deep learning** for advanced sleep pattern detection  
- Investigating **chronotype effects** on sleep efficiency
